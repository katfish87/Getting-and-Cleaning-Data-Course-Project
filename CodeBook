CodeBook describes the variables, data, and transformations/work performed to clean up this data set.

Data Description:

1.	Download the zip file from the following link: 
          https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2.	Unzip
3.	Run the script titled, “peer assignment”
4.	The script will produce a text file titled, “tidy.txt”
a.	Row 1 of the text file: 
5.	For more information regarding the zip file, please navigate to:

Transformations/Work Performed

1.	The file was downloaded and unzipped
2.	The data was read into R in the following order:
    a.	Training Data
        i.	trainingSubjects
        ii.	trainingValues
        iii.	trainingActivity
    b.	Test Data
        i.	testSubjects
        ii.	testValues
        iii.	testActivity
    c.	Features
    d.	Activity Labels
3.	The training and test sets were merged to create one data set
    a.	humanActivity was created using rbind and cbind
4.	Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted
    a.	Apply grepl
5.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    a.	Pull rows 1 and 2 from activity column in humanActivity frame
6.	The data set was labeled with descriptive variable names
    a.	Removed uncessary syntax
    b.	Replaced “f” and “t” with “frequencyDomain” and “timeDomain”
    c.	Replaced “Acc”, “Gyro”, “Mag”, “Freq”, “mean”, “std”, “BodyBody” with: “Accelerometer”, “Gyroscope”, “Magnitude”, “Frequency”, “Mean”, “StandardDeviation”, and “Body”
7.	A tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Variables created are mentioned above.
